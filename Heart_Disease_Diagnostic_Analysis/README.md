<h1>Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis</h1>


<p>
  This project focuses on the analysis of heart disease data to identify key factors associated with heart disease risk and to develop a predictive model using logistic regression. The analysis was performed using Python and various libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used contains 1025 records and 14 features.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  Over the course of this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the heart disease dataset, aiming to uncover significant patterns and trends related to heart disease risk factors. Key steps in the project included data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a logistic regression model to predict heart disease.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the accuracy of the dataset.</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify important trends and correlations.</li>
  <li>Development of a logistic regression model with an accuracy of 85.7%.</li>
  <li>Detailed visualizations to illustrate the significance of various heart disease risk factors.</li>
  <li>Interpretation of model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on heart disease prediction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core programming language for data analysis and modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Used for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Matplotlib and Seaborn:</strong> Employed for data visualization.</li>
  <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Statistical model used for binary classification.</li>
  <li><strong>MS Power BI:</strong> Dashboard.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  The analysis revealed that features such as chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression are strong predictors of heart disease. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 85.7%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the provided features.
